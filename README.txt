--Ryan's Game Engine--
======================

General Info:

This is a small-scale game Engine developed solely
by me. I have coded it in C++ using QT, glew, and 
OpenGL. All of the math libraries located in the
"ProjectFiles\Engine\Math" directory are all hard
coded by me. I use Vectors and Matricies from my 
own library along with QT and OpenGL to draw basic
2D shapes on the screen.

Demo Information:

To start the demo, run the exe inside the 'Demo'
folder. Use the left and right arrows to rotate
the drawn triangle and press space to accelerate
the triangle forward.

Future:

The project is in its very early stages right now.
In the near future I plan to integrate 3D display
and basic physics collisions between drawn objects.
